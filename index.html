<p>In Uganda, we hardly have cameras on the streets and even if they are there, They hardly help. Given the fact that they exist in some spots, we intend to maximize the few we have and that is the solo reason we came up with this application. This Application will be ported to various platforms and shall be available under the Debian, Red-hat and Windows with modifications still missing for MAC-BOOKS. No worries, You'll get a copy but Source code won't be publicly available. </p>
