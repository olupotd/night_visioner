Given the fact that they exist in some spots, we intend to maximize the few we have and that is the solo reason we came up with this application. This Application will be ported to various platforms and shall be available under the Debian, Red-hat and Windows with modifications still missing for MAC-BOOKS. No worries, You'll get a copy but Source code won't be publicly available. \r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nI'm the sole contributor to this project and if you have any questions what so ever, fork me (@olupotd) and lets talk business.\r\nso eve","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
